The following files already contains a trained model to predict the card. However, since most of the files required are inputted manually using File Path, it might be required to manually change the path. However, if the files location are unchanged, background and overlays should be fine.
The Program (Game) itself is ran using a Spyder, coded in both JupyterNotebook and Spyder. The training is done locally on JupyerNotebook. All of the programs required were ran in a single Environment of Anaconda, a KERAS and TensorFlow will be required for the Machine Learning Libraries, while OpenCV will be required for the detection and filtering.
The camera used to run this program is an iPhone 13 main wide camera. The is connected through USB and image is recieved to an app called Camo.
